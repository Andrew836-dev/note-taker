## Installation
[Click here for my Heroku deployment](https://take-note-andrew.herokuapp.com)  
Or you could fork, clone and use node to run it from the command line on your own machine.
## Usage
The home page has a "Get Started" button, which will send you to the notes page. A note may be filled out and then saved by clicking the save icon :floppy_disk: in the top right. Saved notes will appear on the left of the screen and can be clicked on to view again.  
Clicking the pencil :pencil2: icon in the top right will clear the note text and allow you to type a new note.  
Saved notes can also be deleted by clicking the red bin.
